                Long ago, there was Sunny G. Using the four elements, he built and shaped the world, 
                making the story of earth, water, fire, and air an ancient tale that has been told in 
                many different cultures throughout history. 
                
                Now the guardian of UCSD, Sunny G, tired of students not filling out CAPES, has decided 
                to reward the power of elemental-bending to diligent students who fill out their CAPES. 
                However, unsure on which element is the strongest, he has put together a competition for 
                the elements to demonstrate their strength.

               Upon the dawn of the new millennium, energy has become currency, the most precious resource after majority 
               of Earth's resources have been mined out. You are an energy corporation with the technology of Collectors, 
               robots that can mine a energy rich resource known as Energium on the asteroid belts of our solar system. 
               But time is of the essence, and these robots need an AI to help them run effectively and mine as much 
               energium possible before time runs out. What makes matters worse is, there's always a rival corporation on 
               the same asteroid for some reason, trying to mine the resources too! Your goal is to build the best AI agent 
               to control these collectors and get more energy than your competitors. Also, for some reason in 1000 years, 
               Javascript, Python, and Java continue to be prevalent languages for AI.

                Welcome to the 2nd ACM AI Competition, completely unique and different from any other competition. 
                You must use your wits and strategies, along with knowledge of programming, to create an intelligent 
                bot that beats all of the other competitors.

                Welcome to ACM AI's first competition, and the first of its kind at UCSD. 
                You must use your wits and strategies, along with knowledge of programming, 
                to effectively hide and seek. Your AI must be able to play the Seeker and 
                the Hider, and must either find and tag all hiders or hide from all seekers. 
                Are you up for the challenge?
