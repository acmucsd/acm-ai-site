          <p>This was the first ACM AI Competition, and the first of its kind at UCSD. You must use your wits and strategies, along with knowledge of programming, to effectively hide and see. Your AI must be able to play the <span className='seeker'>Seeker</span> and the <span className='hider'>Hider</span>, and must either find and tag all <span className='hider'>hiders</span> or hide from all <span className='seeker'>seekers</span>. Are you up for the challenge? Make sure to join our community through discord here: <a href='https://discord.gg/XsG5etY'>https://discord.gg/XsG5etY</a></p>

          <h1 className='statement'>Ranking üìà</h1>
          <p>So you submitted your bot. What now? Check out the leaderboard to see how well your bot is doing! After submitting, you will need to give our servers some time to get around to scheduling matches for your bot.</p>
          <p>The way we rank players is through the Trueskill ranking system developed by Microsoft. You have 3 values associated with your ranking, a score, a mu (¬µ), and a sigma (œÉ)</p>
          <p>Mu represents our absolute measure of your bot's skill. Sigma represents our confidence in that measure, with lower meaning higher confidence. Your score is then calculated as ¬µ - 3 * œÉ and all players are ranked according to that</p>
          <p>
            To calculate final rankings for prizes, we close the submissions after the deadline and will use the latest bot you submitted. We reset all rankings and run the whole tournament for 3 days to get a more accurate depiction of the true skill levels of each bot through many many matches.
          </p>
