      "description": "Long ago, there was Sunny G. Using the four elements, he built and shaped the world, making the story of earth, water, fire, and air an ancient tale that has been told in many different cultures throughout history. Now the guardian of UCSD, Sunny G, tired of students not filling out CAPES, has decided to reward the power of elemental-bending to diligent students who fill out their CAPES. However, unsure on which element is the strongest, he has put together a competition for the elements to demonstrate their strength. We would like to thank our sponsor, Arjay Waran (RJ), for funding this competition to further AI and competitive programming. This competition has concluded. Congratulations to Team Shubham on their win.",

You are an energy corporation with the technology of Collectors, robots that can mine an energy-rich resource known as Energium on the asteroid belts of our solar system. Your goal is to build the best AI agent to control these collectors and get more energy than your competitors. This competition has concluded. Congratulations to programjames on their win.",

You must use your wits and strategies, along with knowledge of programming, to effectively hide and seek. Your AI must be able to play the Seeker and the Hider, and must either find and tag all hiders or hide from all seekers. Are you up for the challenge? The competition has concluded. Congratulations to Joe Cai for winning the Hide and Seek AI Competition and to Matei Gardus for winning the hacker award.",
