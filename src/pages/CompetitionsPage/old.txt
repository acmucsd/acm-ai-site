                Long ago, there was Sunny G. Using the four elements, he built
                and shaped the world, making the story of earth, water, fire,
                and air an ancient tale that has been told in many different
                cultures throughout history. Now the guardian of UCSD, Sunny G,
                tired of students not filling out CAPES, has decided to reward
                the power of elemental-bending to diligent students who fill out
                their CAPES. However, unsure on which element is the strongest,
                he has put together a competition for the elements to
                demonstrate their strength.

                We would like to thank our sponsor, Arjay Waran (RJ), for
                funding this competition to further AI and competitive
                programming.

                Upon the dawn of the new millennium, energy has become currency,
                the most precious resource after majority of Earth's resources
                have been mined out. You are an energy corporation with the
                technology of Collectors, robots that can mine a energy rich
                resource known as Energium on the asteroid belts of our solar
                system. But time is of the essence, and these robots need an AI
                to help them run effectively and mine as much energium possible
                before time runs out. What makes matters worse is, there's
                always a rival corporation on the same asteroid for some reason,
                trying to mine the resources too! Your goal is to build the best
                AI agent to control these collectors and get more energy than
                your competitors. Also, for some reason in 1000 years,
                Javascript, Python, and Java continue to be prevalent languages
                for AI.

                intelligent bot that beats all of the other competitors.

                Welcome to ACM AI's first competition, and the first of its kind
                at UCSD. You must use your wits and strategies, along with
                knowledge of programming, to effectively hide and seek. Your AI
                must be able to play the Seeker and the Hider, and must either
                find and tag all hiders or hide from all seekers. Are you up for
                the challenge?
