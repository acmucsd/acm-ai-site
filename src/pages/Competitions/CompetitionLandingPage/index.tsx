# Introduction

Long ago, there was Sunny G. Using the four elements, he built and shaped the world, making the story of earth, water, fire, and air an ancient tale that has been told in many different cultures throughout history. 

Now the guardian of UCSD, Sunny G, tired of students not filling out CAPES, has decided to reward the power of elemental-bending to diligent students who fill out their CAPES. However, unsure on which element is the strongest, he has put together a competition for the elements to demonstrate their strength.

Welcome to Element.AI, ACM AIâ€™s very first sponsored competition.
