          <br />
          <p>Welcome to the 2nd ACM AI Competition, completely unique and different from any other competition. You must use your wits and strategies, along with knowledge of programming, to create an intelligent bot that beats all of the other competitors. Here's a quick back story</p>
          
          <br />
          <p>Upon the dawn of the new millenium, energy has become currency, the most precious resource after majority of Earth's resources have been mined out. You are an energy corporation with the technology of <strong>Collectors</strong>, robots that can mine a energy rich resource known as <Energium /> on the asteroid belts of our solar system.

But time is of the essence, and these robots need an AI to help them run effectively and mine as much energium possible before time runs out. What makes matters worse is, there's always a rival corporation on the same asteroid for some reason, trying to mine the resources too! Your goal is to build the best AI agent to control these collectors and get more energy than your competitors. Also, for some reason in 1000 years, Javascript, Python, and Java continue to be prevalent langauges for AI.</p>
          <br />
          <p>For details on <strong>specs</strong>, <strong>code</strong>, and how the game works, check out the <a href='https://github.com/acmucsd/energium-ai-2020' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">github!</a> We also love open source, so star the repository and feel free to contribute anything!</p>
          <br />
          <p>Be sure to join our competition discord at <CompetitionDiscordLink /> to talk strategy, ask questions, find teammates, or get help on bugs and more! Read below for details on how the competition rankings work and what the prizes are and the rules</p>

        <div className='main-section'>
          <h1 style={{color: "white"}}>Competition Info</h1>
          <h1 className='statement'>Ranking üìà</h1>
          <p>So you submitted your bot. What now? Check out the leaderboard to see how well your bot is doing! After submitting, you will need to give our servers some time to get around to scheduling matches for your bot.</p>
          <p>The way we rank players is through the Trueskill ranking system developed by Microsoft. You have 3 values associated with your ranking, a score, a mu (¬µ), and a sigma (œÉ)</p>
          <p>Mu represents our absolute measure of your bot's skill. Sigma represents our confidence in that measure, with lower meaning higher confidence. Your score is then calculated as ¬µ - 3 * œÉ and all players are ranked according to that</p>
          <p>
            To calculate final rankings for prizes, we close the submissions after the deadline and will use the latest bot you submitted. We reset all rankings and run the whole tournament for a day to get a more accurate depiction of the true skill levels of each bot through many many matches.
          </p>
          <br />
